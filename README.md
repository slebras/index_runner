# KBase Index Runner / Knowledge Engine

This is a background service that listens to events from the KBase Workspace and automatically generates graph data and search indexes to enrich the workspace object data.

## Architecture

The index runner uses a hierarchy of parallel processes:

```
ParentProcess
KafkaConsumer------------+
|                        |
|                        |
v                        v
ElasticsearchIndexer     RelationEngineImporter
|
|
v
ElasticsearchWriter
```

* The parent process for the app runs a Kafka event consumer
* The parent process spawns child workers -- ElasticsearchIndexer and RelationEngineImporter
  * The ElasticsearchIndexer receives workspace events and generates index documents for ES
  * The ElasticsearchIndexer spawns a child worker called ElasticsearchWriter
    * ElasticsearchWriter receives index documents from ElasticsearchIndexer and saves them in bulk to ES
  * The RelationEngineImporter receives workspace events and saves vertices and edges in ArangoDB via the RE API

Each of the above modules (ElasticsearchIndexer, ElasticsearchWriter, and RelationEngineImporter) represents a "worker group", or a collection of processes that receive work from a fair-share queue. The number of workers in each group can be scaled up and down individually using environment variables.

## Development

Start the servers:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Run the tests (servers need not be running, and will be shut down if they are):

```sh
make test
```

## Admininstration

Some CLI admin tools are provided in the `indexer_admin` script. For a running container:

```sh
docker exec container_name indexer_admin
```

Examples:

Show command help: `indexer_admin -h`

_Reindex a specific object_ 

```sh
# Reindex only if the doc does not exist
indexer_admin reindex --ref 11/22

# Reindex and overwrite any existing doc
indexer_admin reindex --ref 11/22 --overwrite
```

_Reindex a workspace_

```sh
# Reindex only objects that do not exist
indexer_admin reindex --ref 11

# Reindex and overwrite any existing docs
indexer_admin reindex --ref 11 --overwrite
```

_Reindex a range of workspaces_

```sh
# Index workspaces 1 through 10
indexer_admin reindex_range --min 1 --max 10

# Index workspaces 1 through 10, overwriting existing docs
indexer_admin reindex_range --min 1 --max 10 --overwrite

# Index from workspace 1 through 1000
indexer_admin reindex_range  --max 1000
```

_Get a count of indexing errors_

```sh
# Total error count
indexer_admin err_count

# Error count by type
indexer_admin err_count --by-type
```

_Get all the upas that had an error_

Note: this outputs ALL upas to stdout. You might want to pipe this into a file.

```sh
indexer_admin err_upas
```

### Deployment

Build the image:

```sh
IMAGE_NAME=kbase/index_runner2:{VERSION} sh hooks/build
```

Push to docker hub

```sh
docker push kbase/index_runner2:{VERSION}
```

### Project anatomy

* The main process and entrypoint for the app lives in `./src/index_runner/main.py`
* The workspace events consumer is in `./src/index_runner/workspace_consumer.py`
* The elasticsearch updates consumer is in `./src/index_runner/elasticsearch_consumer.py`

## KBase Search Stack

* [Index Runner](https://github.com/kbaseIncubator/index_runner_deluxe) - Kafka consumer to construct indexes and documents.
* [Elasticsearch Writer](https://github.com/kbaseIncubator/elasticsearch_writer<Paste>) - Kafka consumer to bulk update documents in ES.
* [Search API](https://github.com/kbaseIncubator/search_api_deluxe) - HTTP API for performing search queries.
* [Search Config](https://github.com/kbaseIncubator/search_config) - Global search configuration.

## Creating an SDK indexer application

The index runner has the ability to use SDK modules for indexing. Modules should use the following as input:

```
typedef structure {
	string obj_data_path;
	string ws_info_path;
	string obj_data_v1_path;
} inputParams;
```

Each of the above fields are paths to JSON files that contain relevant object
data (written to disk to avoid using too much memory).

The output for the indexer module is expected to be written to a file.
Each line of the returned file corresponds to one JSON document to be saved in Elasticsearch.

_Example output:_

```json
{ "doc": { "key1": "value1", "key2": "value2" } }
```

If the module outputs more than one Elasticsearch document, the `sub_type` and `sub_id` fields must be specified for all but the 'parent' document. The `sub_type` field should be the same for all the sub objects and should only contain alphanumeric characters, excluding whitespaces. The `sub_id` field MUST be unique for each subobject. If the `sub_id` field is not unique, only one of the objects will be indexed.

_Example output:_

```
{"doc": {"key1": 1, "key2": "string of interest"}}
{"doc": {"sub_key1": 3, "sub_key2": "value"}, "sub_type": "feature", "sub_id": "LKJCID"}
{"doc": {"sub_key1": 6, "sub_key2": "different value"}, "sub_type": "feature", "sub_id": "OIMQME"}
```

The output from your SDK module should contain the filepath for the above data. The file must be written to the scratch space of the sdk application, whose path can be accessed from `config['scratch']`.

```
# Example output from your SDK module's indexer method:
result = {
	"filepath": os.path.join(config['scratch'], "my_output.json")
}
```

NOTE: Before you can use an SDK module as an indexer, it must be registered in the KBase environment you are using.

### Registering your SDK indexer module

To register your application with the index runner, you must open a pull request against the [search config repo](https://github.com/kbaseIncubator/search_config). In the `config.yaml` file, the `sdk_indexer_apps` section is a mapping from KBase object types (excluding version) to their appropriate SDK module and method.

Example:

```
  KBaseMatrices.MetaboliteMatrix:
    sdk_app: kbasematrices_indexer # required
    sdk_func: run_kbasematrices_indexer # required
    sub_obj_index: attribute_mapping # required for indexers that have subobjects
```

NOTE: `attribute_mapping` is the string name of the sub_obj_index for `KBaseMatrices.MetaboliteMatrix`.

You may also specify `sdk_version`, which corresponds to the version of the SDK module you would like to use.

An Elasticsearch type mapping is also required. This can be added to the `mappings` field in the config. Several examples are available in the `config.yaml` file.
